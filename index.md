## 🚀 Hey there! Welcome to My Corner of the AI Universe

<p align="center">
  <em>Cooking up cool AI solutions with a sprinkle of LLM magic and a dash of NLP.</em>
</p>

I'm Mohammad Shojaei, an **AI Engineer** who genuinely gets a buzz from building smart systems with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **NLP**. My mission? To take gnarly, complex problems and transform them into sleek, intelligent AI solutions that actually make a difference. I spend my days (and sometimes nights!) diving deep into **RAG setups**, **fine-tuning models** to perfection, and architecting **autonomous AI agents** that are *this* close to taking over the world (just kidding... mostly 😉).

Currently building AI-powered financial analysis systems at **No Limits Market Ltd** in Dubai, UAE, where I get to flex my LLM muscles on real-world problems.

### 🎯 **What I'm Up To:**
*   🚀 **Currently:** Pushing the boundaries of LLMs for advanced research, building AI-powered study buddies, and making specialized models even brainier
*   🤓 **Always Learning:** Tinkering with the latest LLM tricks, figuring out MLOps for smooth sailing, and exploring multimodal AI
*   💬 **Let's Chat:** Got questions about RAG, fine-tuning, or why custom embeddings are the bee's knees? Curious about my work with Persian NLP? Hit me up!
*   ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I'm developing [OllamaDesktop](https://github.com/mshojaei77/ollama-desktop), a fully open-source app making powerful LLMs, vision, RAG, and Agents super easy to use for everyone. Eager developers needed – come contribute!

> **"Transforming complex AI research into production-ready solutions that solve real business problems."**
