## 🚀 What I Do

I design, develop, and deploy **LLM-powered products** from RAG systems to multi-agent workflows under production constraints (latency < 250ms, cost optimization, scalability). My focus is translating research into **maintainable, observable services** that deliver business value at scale.

### Recent Impact Highlights
- 🔬 **45% reduction** in financial analyst research time through RAG-based platform at No Limits Market
- ⚡ **35% infrastructure cost savings** via AWQ quantization and optimized batching strategies  
- 🎯 **90% accuracy** multilingual chatbot serving 50K+ monthly queries in real estate sector
- 🏥 **70% EEG artifact detection** accuracy using 1D-CNN & Transformer hybrids in healthcare
- 🤗 **100K+ downloads** across 12 Persian LLMs and 21 datasets on Hugging Face

## 🎓 Additional Learning Resources

Beyond the comprehensive book, explore these focused resources:

- 🗺️ [Complete LLM Roadmap](roadmap.html) - Step-by-step learning path
