# Traditional Language Models

Traditional language models form the foundation of modern NLP and are crucial for understanding the evolution towards transformer-based architectures. This guide provides an overview of classical approaches to language modeling.

## N-gram Language Models and Smoothing Techniques

- **N-gram Models**
  - Probability calculations
  - Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  - Context window approaches
  - Markov assumption

- **Smoothing Methods**
  - Laplace (Add-1) smoothing
  - Add-k smoothing
  - Good-Turing smoothing
  - Kneser-Ney smoothing
  - Backoff and interpolation

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Perplexity
  - Cross-entropy
  - Out-of-vocabulary handling

## Feedforward Neural Language Models

- **Architecture Overview**
  - Input representation
  - Projection layer
  - Hidden layers
  - Output softmax
  - Fixed context window

- **Training Process**
  - Word embeddings
  - Continuous space language models
  - Handling vocabulary size
  - Mini-batch training

- **Limitations**
  - Fixed context size
  - Lack of parameter sharing
  - Scalability issues

## Recurrent Neural Network Language Models

- **Basic RNN Architecture**
  - Hidden state representation
  - Time-step processing
  - Backpropagation through time (BPTT)
  - Vanishing/exploding gradients

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

- **LSTM Components**
  - Input gate
  - Forget gate
  - Output gate
  - Cell state
  - Hidden state

### Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

- **GRU Architecture**
  - Reset gate
  - Update gate
  - Candidate activation
  - Final activation

### Bidirectional and Multilayer RNNs

- **Architecture Types**
  - Bidirectional processing
  - Deep RNN design
  - Residual connections
  - Layer normalization
