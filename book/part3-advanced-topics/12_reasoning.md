**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Prompt Engineering
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Beyond simple pattern matching, the frontier of LLM research is in enabling models to "think" deliberately. This chapter explores the prompting techniques and training methodologies designed to elicit and improve multi-step reasoning, moving models from fast, intuitive "System 1" thinking to slow, deliberate "System 2" problem-solving.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Chain-of-Thought (CoT)</h4>
    <p>Prompting a model to "think step-by-step" to break down complex problems into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, which often leads to the correct answer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)</h4>
    <p>An advanced technique where the model explores multiple reasoning paths at once, forming a tree structure, and uses self-evaluation to decide which path to pursue.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>ReAct (Reason + Act)</h4>
    <p>A framework that combines reasoning with action, allowing models to use tools (like a search engine or calculator) to gather information and solve problems.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Process Supervision vs. Outcome Supervision</h4>
    <p>The idea of rewarding a model for a correct *reasoning process* rather than just a correct final answer, which can lead to more robust and generalizable models.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Self-Correction & Self-Consistency</h4>
    <p>Techniques where a model critiques its own work or generates multiple reasoning paths and takes the majority answer, improving reliability.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Process Reward Models (PRMs)</h4>
    <p>Reward models trained to evaluate each individual step in a reasoning chain, used in Process-Supervised RLHF.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Design and test few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompts for solving logic puzzles or multi-step math problems.
2.  **ReAct Agent**: Build a simple agent using the ReAct framework that can use a calculator tool to answer arithmetic questions.
3.  **Self-Consistency**: Implement a self-consistency loop where you prompt a model to generate multiple reasoning chains for the same problem and then programmatically extract the most common answer.
