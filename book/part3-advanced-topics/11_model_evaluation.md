# 11. Model Evaluation
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Statistics, Model Training
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This chapter addresses the complex and evolving field of LLM evaluation. We explore standardized benchmarks for measuring capabilities, the emerging practice of using LLMs to judge other LLMs, and the critical importance of testing for safety and bias.

## Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Academic Benchmarks</h4>
    <p>Standardized tests like MMLU (general knowledge), GSM8K (math), and HumanEval (code) used to compare models' core capabilities.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Human Evaluation</h4>
    <p>The gold standard of evaluation, where humans rate model responses, often in head-to-head comparisons (e.g., Chatbot Arena).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>LLM-as-a-Judge</h4>
    <p>Using a powerful "judge" LLM (like GPT-4) to automatically evaluate the quality of another model's output, which is faster and cheaper than human evaluation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Bias and Safety Testing</h4>
    <p>Using specialized benchmarks and prompts (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts) to measure a model's propensity to generate toxic, biased, or otherwise harmful content.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Fairness Assessment</h4>
    <p>Evaluating whether a model's performance and behavior are equitable across different demographic groups.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Evaluation Frameworks</h4>
    <p>Libraries and tools (like the EleutherAI Eval Harness) that standardize the process of running benchmarks on different models.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Practical Exercises

1.  **Run a Standard Benchmark**: Use the EleutherAI Eval Harness to evaluate a model of your choice on a benchmark like MMLU or HellaSwag.
2.  **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Create a simple "LLM-as-a-judge" script that uses a powerful LLM to compare and score the outputs of two different models on a set of prompts.
3.  **Bias and Toxicity Testing**: Use a library like `detoxify` or a benchmark like RealToxicityPrompts to measure the toxicity of a model's outputs.
