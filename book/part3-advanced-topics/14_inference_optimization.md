# 14. Inference Optimization
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** Model Deployment
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Getting a model to run is one thing; getting it to run *fast* is another. This chapter is all about inference optimization‚Äîthe collection of software and algorithmic tricks used to maximize throughput (tokens per second) and minimize latency when serving a Large Language Model.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>KV Caching</h4>
    <p>The fundamental optimization for autoregressive decoding, where the keys and values of past tokens are cached to avoid redundant computation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>FlashAttention</h4>
    <p>A memory-aware attention algorithm that avoids writing the large attention matrix to HBM, resulting in significant speedups, especially for long sequences.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>PagedAttention</h4>
    <p>An algorithm inspired by virtual memory and paging that allows for more efficient management of the KV Cache, reducing memory waste.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Continuous Batching</h4>
    <p>A serving strategy that processes incoming requests continuously instead of in static batches, dramatically increasing total throughput.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Speculative Decoding</h4>
    <p>Using a small, fast "draft" model to generate several tokens in parallel, which are then verified by the larger, more powerful model, speeding up decoding.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Inference Servers</h4>
    <p>Specialized serving frameworks like vLLM and TensorRT-LLM that implement many of these optimizations out-of-the-box.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Benchmark an Inference Server**: Use a framework like vLLM to host an open-source model and benchmark its throughput and latency with different batching configurations.
2.  **Implement KV Caching**: (Advanced) Manually implement a simple KV cache in a basic transformer generation loop to understand its impact.
3.  **Speculative Decoding**: Use a library that supports speculative decoding (like `transformers`) to measure the speedup from using a small draft model to assist a larger one.
