# 15. Model Architecture Variants
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** Transformer Architecture
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The standard Transformer is not the only architecture in town. This chapter explores the cutting edge of LLM design, looking at variants that challenge the quadratic complexity of attention and introduce new paradigms like sparsity and recurrence, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of scale and efficiency.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Mixture of Experts (MoE)</h4>
    <p>An architecture where multiple "expert" feed-forward networks exist, and a router network decides which tokens get sent to which expert, allowing for huge models with constant inference cost.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Sparse vs. Dense Models</h4>
    <p>The difference between a standard "dense" model where all parameters are used for every token, and a "sparse" MoE model where only a fraction of parameters are used.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>State Space Models (SSMs)</h4>
    <p>A class of models, like Mamba, that are inspired by classical control theory and can process sequences in linear time, making them extremely fast for inference.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Mamba & Selective SSMs</h4>
    <p>A specific, highly successful SSM architecture that uses a selection mechanism to decide which information to keep in its state, combining the efficiency of RNNs with the power of Transformers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value)</h4>
    <p>A novel architecture that combines the parallelizable training of a Transformer with the efficient inference of an RNN.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Long-Context Architectures</h4>
    <p>Techniques like sliding window attention (Mistral) or modified positional encodings (YaRN) that allow models to handle much longer context windows than the original Transformer.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Run an MoE Model**: Use a library like `transformers` to run an open-source MoE model like Mixtral 8x7B and observe its memory usage and output.
2.  **Run a Mamba Model**: Explore a Mamba implementation and compare its generation speed and memory usage to a similarly-sized Transformer model.
3.  **Implement Sliding Window Attention**: (Advanced) Manually implement a sliding window attention mechanism in a simple Transformer to understand how it reduces computation.
