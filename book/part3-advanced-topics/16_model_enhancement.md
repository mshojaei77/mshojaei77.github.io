## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Context Window Extension with Advanced Techniques**
Extend model context windows using advanced techniques like YaRN and position interpolation. Apply context extension methods to pre-trained models and fine-tune on long-text data. Evaluate ability to recall information from extended contexts and implement recovery strategies for model degradation.

**2. Model Merging and Ensembling Systems**
Merge models effectively while preserving capabilities from each source model. Implement model composition techniques for improved performance and create ensembling systems. Build frameworks for combining multiple specialized models into unified systems.

**3. Knowledge Distillation and Model Compression**
Implement knowledge distillation to create efficient compressed models. Build teacher-student training pipelines and create smaller, faster models for mobile deployment. Compare performance across different compression techniques and optimization methods.

**4. Continual Learning and Self-Improvement**
Build continual learning systems that can adapt to new data without forgetting. Implement self-improvement mechanisms for ongoing model enhancement and create systems that can learn from user feedback and interactions over time.
