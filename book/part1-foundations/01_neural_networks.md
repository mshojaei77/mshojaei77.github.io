# 1. Neural Networks
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Calculus, Linear Algebra
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding all modern language models. We explore the fundamental building blocks of neural networks, from the simplest perceptron to the complexities of training deep, multi-layered architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Perceptron From Scratch**: Implement a perceptron in NumPy to classify the Iris dataset, visualizing the decision boundary as it learns.
2.  **Autograd & Activation Playground**: Extend a tiny autograd engine (like `micrograd`) to support various activation functions and train an MLP.
3.  **Regularization Lab**: Use PyTorch to train a model on Fashion-MNIST, applying L2 regularization, Dropout, and Early Stopping to combat overfitting.
4.  **Optimizer Showdown**: Benchmark different optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW) and learning rate schedulers on a small image dataset like CIFAR-10.
