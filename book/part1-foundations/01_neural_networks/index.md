# Neural Networks

**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Calculus, Linear Algebra
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Welcome to the engine room of modern AI, the ghost in the machine. Neural networks are the computational heart of technologies that feel like magic, from cars that drive themselves to language models that can write poetry, code, and suspiciously convincing excuses for being late. This chapter peels back the curtain, revealing the elegant mathematical principles that allow these systems to learn from data. We'll start with intuition and build up, layer by layer, until the advanced architectures in the rest of this book feel like old friends.
