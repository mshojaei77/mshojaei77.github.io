# 5. Transformer Architecture
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** Neural Networks, Linear Algebra
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This chapter dissects the revolutionary architecture that powers virtually all modern Large Language Models. We move beyond sequential processing and explore the parallelizable, attention-based framework introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, building a deep understanding of how transformers work from the ground up.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>The Encoder-Decoder Stack</h4>
    <p>The overall architecture, comprising stacks of encoders and decoders, and how it's adapted for different model types (encoder-only, decoder-only).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Self-Attention</h4>
    <p>The core mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence to compute a representation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Query, Key, and Value</h4>
    <p>The three matrices derived from the input embeddings that are used to compute attention scores.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Multi-Head Attention</h4>
    <p>The process of running the attention mechanism in parallel multiple times to allow the model to focus on different parts of the input.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Positional Encodings</h4>
    <p>The technique used to inject information about the order of tokens into the model, since the self-attention mechanism itself is permutation-invariant.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Feed-Forward Networks & Residuals</h4>
    <p>The other key components within a transformer block, including the position-wise feed-forward networks and the crucial residual connections.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Self-Attention from Scratch**: Implement the scaled dot-product attention mechanism in NumPy or PyTorch to develop a strong intuition for how it works.
2.  **Full Transformer Block**: Build a complete Transformer encoder block, including multi-head attention, residual connections, layer normalization, and the feed-forward network.
3.  **Positional Encoding Comparison**: Implement and visualize sinusoidal, learned, and rotary positional encodings (RoPE) to understand their different properties.
4.  **Mini-GPT Implementation**: Build a small, decoder-only transformer (a "mini-GPT") and train it on a small text corpus to generate text.
