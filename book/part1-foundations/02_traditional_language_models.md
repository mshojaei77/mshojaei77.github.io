# 2. Traditional Language Models

**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Probability, Statistics
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Before transformers, a different class of models paved the way for modern NLP. This chapter explores the statistical and recurrent architectures that were once state-of-the-art, providing essential context for why the transformer architecture was such a breakthrough.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>N-gram Language Models</h4>
    <p>Statistical models that predict the next word based on the previous N words, introducing concepts like smoothing and perplexity.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Feedforward Neural LMs</h4>
    <p>The first attempts to use neural networks for language, which introduced distributed representations but suffered from fixed context windows.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h4>
    <p>Architectures designed for sequences, introducing the idea of a hidden state to maintain memory of past elements.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>LSTMs & GRUs</h4>
    <p>Advanced RNN variants that use gating mechanisms to solve the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)</h4>
    <p>The encoder-decoder framework that became the standard for tasks like machine translation, combining RNNs to map input sequences to output sequences.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Attention Mechanisms</h4>
    <p>The key innovation that allowed Seq2Seq models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input, overcoming the bottleneck of a single context vector.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **N-Gram Model with Smoothing**: Implement a word-level N-gram model from scratch, applying various smoothing techniques to handle unseen n-grams and evaluating with perplexity.
2.  **RNN Architecture Comparison**: Build and train an RNN, LSTM, and GRU on a sentiment analysis task, comparing their ability to handle sequences of varying lengths and avoid vanishing gradients.
3.  **Seq2Seq with Attention**: Create a character-level machine translation model using an RNN-based Seq2Seq architecture with Bahdanau-style attention, and visualize the attention weights.
