# 7. Pre-Training Large Language Models
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Expert | **Prerequisites:** Transformers, Distributed Systems
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This is where the magic happens. This chapter delves into the resource-intensive, technically complex process of pre-training a Large Language Model from scratch. We'll cover the core training objectives, the distributed computing strategies required to train at scale, and the optimization techniques that make it all feasible.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Pre-training Objectives</h4>
    <p>The self-supervised learning tasks used to train the model, primarily Causal Language Modeling (CLM) for decoder-only models like GPT.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Scaling Laws</h4>
    <p>The empirical relationships between model performance, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, which guide the design of new models.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Data Parallelism</h4>
    <p>The most common distributed strategy, where the data is sharded across multiple GPUs and models are replicated.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Model & Tensor Parallelism</h4>
    <p>Advanced techniques (like Megatron-LM) for splitting a single large model across multiple GPUs when it's too big to fit on one.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)</h4>
    <p>An optimization strategy (popularized by DeepSpeed) that partitions the optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across GPUs to save memory.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Mixed-Precision Training</h4>
    <p>Using lower-precision formats like FP16 or BF16 during training to reduce memory usage and speed up computation, while maintaining model accuracy.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Pre-train a Mini-GPT**: Using a clean dataset like TinyStories, pre-train a small decoder-only transformer from scratch, implementing the CLM objective and managing checkpoints.
2.  **Distributed Training with DeepSpeed**: Adapt a PyTorch training script to use DeepSpeed's ZeRO-2 or ZeRO-3 for distributed training across multiple GPUs (or multiple Colab notebooks).
3.  **Analyze Scaling Laws**: Train several small models of different sizes and plot their loss curves to empirically verify the Chinchilla scaling laws.
