# 6. Data Preparation
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Python, SQL
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The quality of a language model is a direct reflection of the data it was trained on. This chapter covers the unglamorous but essential work of preparing massive datasets for LLM training, from sourcing and cleaning to ensuring privacy and quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Web Scraping Pipeline**: Build a data collection pipeline using Scrapy and BeautifulSoup to gather text data from a specific domain (e.g., blogs, news sites).
2.  **Deduplication at Scale**: Implement MinHash and LSH to find and remove near-duplicate documents from a large text corpus like a subset of Common Crawl.
3.  **PII Redaction Tool**: Create a system that uses regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect and redact PII from a dataset.
4.  **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Use an LLM API to generate a small, high-quality instruction-following dataset for a specific task.
