# 8. Post-Training Datasets
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Data Preparation
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

A pre-trained model knows a lot about language, but it doesn't know how to follow instructions or have a conversation. This chapter focuses on creating the specialized datasets used in post-training to teach the model to be a helpful assistant, covering both instruction-following and preference data.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Instruction-Following Datasets</h4>
    <p>Datasets composed of `(instruction, response)` pairs that teach a model how to follow commands and answer questions. (e.g., Alpaca, Dolly)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Preference Datasets</h4>
    <p>Datasets of prompts with multiple responses ranked by human preference (e.g., `(prompt, chosen_response, rejected_response)`), used for alignment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Synthetic Data Generation</h4>
    <p>Using a powerful "teacher" model (like GPT-4) to generate vast quantities of instruction or preference data to train a smaller "student" model.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Data Quality & Curation</h4>
    <p>The critical importance of quality over quantity in post-training datasets, and methods for filtering and curating them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Chat Templates</h4>
    <p>The specific formatting rules a model expects for conversational data, including roles (system, user, assistant) and special tokens.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Multi-turn Conversations</h4>
    <p>Creating datasets that represent coherent, multi-turn dialogues, which are more complex than single instruction-response pairs.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Instruction Dataset Creation**: Manually write 20 high-quality instruction-response pairs for a specific domain, then use those as examples to prompt an LLM to generate 100 more.
2.  **Explore Public Datasets**: Download and analyze a popular instruction-following dataset like Alpaca or a preference dataset like the Anthropic Helpful & Harmless dataset.
3.  **Chat Template Implementation**: Create a Hugging Face chat template for a custom conversational format and use it to format a dialogue correctly.
