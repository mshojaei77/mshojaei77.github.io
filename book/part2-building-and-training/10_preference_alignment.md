## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Comprehensive Reward Model Training and Evaluation**
Create robust reward models that accurately capture human preferences across multiple dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty). Build preference datasets with careful annotation and implement proper evaluation metrics. Handle alignment tax and maintain model capabilities during preference training.

**2. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Implementation**
Implement DPO training to align models with specific preferences like humor, helpfulness, or safety. Create high-quality preference datasets and compare DPO against RLHF approaches. Evaluate alignment quality using both automated and human assessment methods.

**3. Complete RLHF Pipeline with PPO**
Build a full RLHF pipeline from reward model training to PPO-based alignment. Implement proper hyperparameter tuning, stability monitoring, and evaluation frameworks. Handle training instabilities and maintain model performance across different model sizes.

**4. Constitutional AI and Self-Critique Systems**
Implement Constitutional AI systems that can critique and revise their own responses based on defined principles. Create comprehensive evaluation frameworks for principle-based alignment and develop methods for improving model behavior through AI feedback.
