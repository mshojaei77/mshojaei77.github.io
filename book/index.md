# LLMs: From Foundations to Production

A comprehensive guide to mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) ‚Äì from core mathematics and computing principles to production deployment, advanced applications, and emerging research trends.

## üéØ Roadmap Overview

This book is structured as a clear progression from foundational concepts to advanced applications. Master the core principles, build and train models, specialize in advanced topics, and deploy production systems.

| Part | Focus | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| **üîç [Part 1: The Foundations](part1-foundations/)** | Core ML concepts, neural networks, traditional models, tokenization, embeddings, transformers | Python/PyTorch, ML/NLP theory, transformer architecture |
| **üß¨ [Part 2: Building & Training Models](part2-building-and-training/)** | Data preparation, pre-training, fine-tuning, preference alignment | Deep learning theory, distributed training, experimental design |
| **‚öôÔ∏è [Part 3: Advanced Topics & Specialization](part3-advanced-topics/)** | Evaluation, reasoning, optimization, architectures, enhancement | Research methodology, model optimization, architecture design |
| **üöÄ [Part 4: Engineering & Applications](part4-engineering-and-applications/)** | Production deployment, RAG, agents, multimodal, security, ops | Inference, Agents, RAG, LangChain/LlamaIndex, LLMOps |

## üìã Getting Started

### Essential Skills Assessment

Before starting, complete this self-assessment. Rate yourself 1-5 (1=Beginner, 5=Expert):

**Programming & Development**
- [ ] **Python (4/5 required)**: Classes, decorators, async/await, context managers
- [ ] **Git & Version Control (3/5 required)**: Branching, merging, pull requests
- [ ] **Linux/Unix (3/5 required)**: Command line, shell scripting, file permissions

**Mathematics & Statistics**
- [ ] **Linear Algebra (3/5 required)**: Matrix operations, eigenvalues, SVD
- [ ] **Probability & Statistics (3/5 required)**: Distributions, Bayes' theorem, hypothesis testing
- [ ] **Calculus (2/5 required)**: Derivatives, chain rule, gradients

**Machine Learning**
- [ ] **ML Fundamentals (3/5 required)**: Supervised/unsupervised learning, overfitting, validation
- [ ] **Deep Learning (2/5 required)**: Neural networks, backpropagation, optimization

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you scored < 3 in any essential area, take tutorials and improve that area first**
