# 21. Securing LLMs & Responsible AI
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** Security Fundamentals, Ethical AI
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

With great power comes great responsibility. As LLMs become more capable and widespread, ensuring they are secure, fair, and aligned with human values is paramount. This chapter covers the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM security, from common attack vectors to the principles of responsible AI development.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>OWASP Top 10 for LLMs</h4>
    <p>A standard awareness document for developers and security professionals, outlining the most critical security risks for applications using LLMs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Prompt Injection & Jailbreaking</h4>
    <p>The most prominent LLM vulnerability, where attackers use carefully crafted prompts to bypass a model's safety filters or hijack its original instructions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Data Poisoning</h4>
    <p>An attack where malicious data is secretly introduced into a model's training set, creating backdoors or compromising its integrity.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Model Theft & Extraction</h4>
    <p>Attacks aimed at stealing a proprietary model's weights or using carefully crafted queries to extract its training data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Bias, Fairness, and Transparency</h4>
    <p>The ethical challenges of ensuring that LLMs do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes, and the importance of being transparent about their capabilities and limitations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Red Teaming</h4>
    <p>The practice of having a dedicated team of experts (or other AIs) proactively trying to "break" a model to find its vulnerabilities before it's released.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Prompt Injection**: Attempt to "jailbreak" a well-known chat model by crafting prompts designed to bypass its safety instructions.
2.  **Input/Output Filtering**: Build a simple application that uses an LLM and implement basic input and output filters to prevent harmful content.
3.  **Bias Detection**: Use a tool like the Hugging Face `evaluate` library to measure the demographic bias in a model's outputs.
