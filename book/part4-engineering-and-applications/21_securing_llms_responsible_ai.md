## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Comprehensive LLM Security Scanner**
Build comprehensive security testing framework that evaluates LLM applications against OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities. Implement prompt injection detection, jailbreak attempt identification, and data leakage prevention. Create automated security assessment tools with vulnerability reporting and remediation recommendations.

**2. Advanced Guardrail and Safety Systems**
Create multi-layered defense systems with input sanitization, output filtering, and content moderation. Implement Constitutional AI principles for safety alignment and build real-time safety monitoring systems. Include human-in-the-loop validation and emergency response mechanisms.

**3. Bias Detection and Mitigation Framework**
Develop comprehensive bias detection systems that identify demographic, representational, and algorithmic biases. Implement fairness metrics across multiple dimensions and create bias mitigation strategies. Build tools for ongoing bias monitoring and corrective action implementation.

**4. Privacy-Preserving AI and Compliance System**
Implement differential privacy techniques for model training and inference. Build federated learning systems that preserve data privacy while enabling model improvement. Create comprehensive compliance frameworks for GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI regulations with audit trails and accountability mechanisms.
