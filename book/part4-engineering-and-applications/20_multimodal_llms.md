# 20. Multimodal LLMs
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** Computer Vision, Audio Processing
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Language is not the only way we experience the world. This chapter explores multimodal models, a class of LLMs that can process and understand information from multiple modalities at once, including images, audio, and video, leading to a much richer and more capable form of AI.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</h4>
    <p>Models like GPT-4V and LLaVA that can "see" and reason about images, enabling tasks like visual question answering and image captioning.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Vision Encoders</h4>
    <p>The components (often a ViT, or Vision Transformer) that process an image and convert it into a sequence of embeddings that the language model can understand.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)</h4>
    <p>A foundational model from OpenAI that learns to connect text and images by training on a massive dataset of image-caption pairs, enabling powerful zero-shot image classification.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Text-to-Image Generation</h4>
    <p>Models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion that take a text prompt and generate a corresponding image, powered by diffusion models.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech</h4>
    <p>Models like OpenAI's Whisper (speech-to-text) and Voice Engine (text-to-speech) that bridge the gap between spoken language and text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Modality Alignment</h4>
    <p>The challenge of projecting information from different modalities (like text and images) into a shared representation space where they can be compared and processed together.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Visual Question Answering**: Use a VLM like LLaVA to build a simple application that can answer questions about an image you provide.
2.  **Text-to-Image Generation**: Use the `diffusers` library to generate images from text prompts with a model like Stable Diffusion.
3.  **Audio Transcription**: Use OpenAI's Whisper API or a local implementation to transcribe a short audio file into text.
