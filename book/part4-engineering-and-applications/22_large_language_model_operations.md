# 22. Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps)
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** DevOps, MLOps, Cloud Platforms
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

LLMOps is the discipline of managing the end-to-end lifecycle of Large Language Models in production. It adapts the principles of MLOps to the unique challenges of LLMs, covering everything from continuous integration and deployment to monitoring, governance, and cost management. This is how you run LLMs reliably at scale.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Model Lifecycle Management</h4>
    <p>The entire journey of a model, from experiment tracking and versioning in a model registry to staging, production, and eventual retirement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>CI/CD for LLMs</h4>
    <p>Automated pipelines for continuous integration and deployment, including testing, validation, and safe deployment strategies like canary releases and blue-green deployments.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Monitoring & Observability</h4>
    <p>Tracking model performance, latency, cost, and usage in real-time. This includes detecting data drift, performance degradation, and potential misuse.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Containerization & Orchestration</h4>
    <p>Using Docker to package applications and Kubernetes to orchestrate and scale them, which is the industry standard for deploying robust applications.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Cost Management</h4>
    <p>Techniques for tracking and optimizing the significant costs associated with training and serving LLMs, including auto-scaling and using spot instances.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Experiment Management & A/B Testing</h4>
    <p>Tools and practices for running controlled experiments (e.g., A/B testing different prompts or models) and tracking the results to make data-driven decisions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **CI/CD Pipeline for an LLM App**: Build a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically deploys a FastAPI-based LLM application whenever you push a change.
2.  **Model Registry with MLflow**: Use MLflow to track different versions of a fine-tuned model, including its parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
3.  **A/B Testing Prompts**: Set up a simple A/B test to compare the performance of two different system prompts for a chatbot.
