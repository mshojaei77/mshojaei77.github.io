## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Complete MLOps Pipeline with CI/CD**
Build end-to-end MLOps pipeline using GitHub Actions and MLflow that handles model training, validation, packaging, and deployment. Implement automated testing, model versioning, and deployment strategies with proper rollback mechanisms. Include infrastructure as code using Terraform and comprehensive monitoring.

**2. Model Monitoring and Observability Systems**
Create comprehensive monitoring systems using Prometheus, Grafana, and custom metrics that track model performance, inference latency, and business metrics. Implement drift detection, anomaly alerting, and automated remediation. Build real-time dashboards for model health and performance tracking.

**3. A/B Testing and Experimentation Framework**
Design and implement A/B testing framework for model and prompt optimization using statistical analysis and significance testing. Create experimentation platforms with proper randomization, control groups, and success metrics. Build tools for gradual rollouts and automated decision-making.

**4. Multi-Cloud Cost Optimization System**
Build cost optimization systems that automatically scale resources based on demand, implement spot instance strategies, and track costs across multiple cloud providers. Create budget monitoring, resource allocation optimization, and cost prediction models. Implement automated cost-saving recommendations and actions.
