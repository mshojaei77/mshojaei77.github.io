# 18. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
{: .no_toc }

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Prerequisites:** Embeddings, Databases
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

LLMs are powerful, but their knowledge is frozen in time and they can't access your private data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solves this by connecting an LLM to an external knowledge source, allowing it to answer questions and generate text based on information it was never trained on. This is arguably the most important LLM application pattern today.

## üìö Core Concepts

<div class="concept-grid">
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Ingestion & Chunking</h4>
    <p>The process of loading documents and breaking them down into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks suitable for embedding.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Embedding & Indexing</h4>
    <p>Using an embedding model to convert each chunk into a vector, and then storing those vectors in a specialized vector database for efficient search.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Vector Databases</h4>
    <p>Databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma that are optimized for fast similarity search over millions or billions of vectors.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Retrieval</h4>
    <p>The process of taking a user's query, embedding it, and searching the vector database to find the most relevant chunks of text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Augmentation & Generation</h4>
    <p>Taking the retrieved chunks, adding them to the user's prompt as context, and then asking the LLM to generate an answer based on that context.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-grid-item">
    <h4>Advanced Retrieval</h4>
    <p>Techniques beyond simple vector search, such as hybrid search (combining keyword and semantic), re-ranking, and query transformations.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Labs

1.  **Build a Basic RAG Pipeline**: Use LangChain or LlamaIndex to build a simple RAG application that can answer questions about a small set of documents.
2.  **Experiment with Chunking Strategies**: Compare different chunking strategies (e.g., fixed-size vs. semantic) and embedding models to see how they impact retrieval quality.
3.  **Hybrid Search**: Implement a hybrid search system that combines results from both a keyword-based search (like BM25) and a semantic vector search.
