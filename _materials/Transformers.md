# Transformers Tutorial âš¡: Attention Mechanism Explained â€“ Parallel Seq Magic
Hack into transformers guide â€“ the powerhouse behind modern large language models.

## Attention Mechanism Explained
- QKV: Query, Key, Value vectors for scoring.
- Self-Attention: Tokens interact and weigh importance.
- Multi-Head Attention: Multiple perspectives for richer representations.

## Transformers Architecture
- Encoder: Stacked attention + feed-forward layers.
- Decoder: Masked attention + cross-attention.
- Positional Encoding: Sine/cosine to maintain order.

## Training Transformers
- Autoregressive: Predict next token in sequence.
- Scaling: Bigger models, more data = better performance.

## Why Transformers Dominate AI
Parallel processing FTW! How has attention changed your ML game? Spill! ðŸ§©
