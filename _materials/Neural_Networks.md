# Neural Networks Tutorial ðŸ§ : Math and Mechanics for LLM Foundations
Hack into neural networks guide â€“ vectors to backprop, no fluff. Essential for understanding large language models.

## Neural Networks Basics
- Neurons, layers, weights, biases â€“ the building blocks.
- Types: Feedforward, CNN, RNN â€“ when to use what.
- Activations, backpropagation guide, gradient descent hacks.
- Loss functions, regularization, optimizers for peak performance.

## Why Neural Networks Matter in AI
Dive deep into how neural nets power LLMs. Got questions? What's your biggest backprop struggle? ðŸ¤”
