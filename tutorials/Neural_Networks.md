![Section Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d16498d7-25e3-450d-8463-31e751374a38)
*A conceptual visualization of a neural network, highlighting its interconnected nodes and layers.*

## Overview
This section provides a comprehensive introduction to Neural Networks, the foundational models of deep learning. We will explore their architecture, how they learn from data, and the key components that make them powerful tools for solving complex problems.

### What You'll Learn
- Understand the basic architecture of neural networks, including neurons, layers, weights, and biases.
- Learn about different types of neural networks, such as Feedforward, Convolutional, and Recurrent Neural Networks.
- Grasp the concepts of activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
- Explore loss functions, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms.
- Identify best practices for training neural networks and common challenges to avoid.
