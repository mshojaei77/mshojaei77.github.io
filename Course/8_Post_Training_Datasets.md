## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Custom Chat Template for Role-Playing and Complex Conversations**
Design and implement custom Hugging Face chat templates for specialized applications like role-playing models. Handle system prompts, user messages, bot messages, and special tokens for actions or internal thoughts. Create templates supporting multi-turn conversations with proper context management.

**2. High-Quality Instruction Dataset Creation Pipeline**
Build comprehensive pipeline for creating instruction datasets for specific tasks. Manually curate high-quality examples and use them to prompt LLMs to generate larger datasets. Implement quality filters, data annotation best practices, and validation systems to ensure dataset integrity.

**3. Synthetic Conversation Generator for Training**
Create advanced synthetic conversation generator producing diverse, high-quality training conversations. Implement quality control mechanisms, conversation flow validation, and domain-specific conversation patterns. Compare synthetic data effectiveness against real conversation data.

**4. Dataset Quality Assessment and Optimization System**
Develop comprehensive system for evaluating instruction dataset quality across multiple dimensions. Implement automated quality scoring, bias detection, and optimization techniques. Create tools for dataset composition analysis and capability-specific optimization.
