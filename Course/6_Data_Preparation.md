## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Comprehensive Web Scraping and Data Collection Pipeline**
Build robust data collection system using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy for real estate listings. Implement error handling, rate limiting, and data validation. Handle different website structures with quality assessment.

**2. Advanced Data Deduplication with MinHash and LSH**
Implement MinHash and LSH algorithms for efficient near-duplicate detection in large text datasets. Optimize for accuracy and performance, comparing against simpler methods. Apply to C4 or Common Crawl datasets.

**3. Privacy-Preserving Data Processing System**
Create comprehensive PII detection and redaction tool using regex, NER, and ML techniques. Handle sensitive information and implement contamination detection strategies for training datasets.

**4. Synthetic Data Generation and Quality Assessment**
Use LLM APIs to generate high-quality synthetic instruction datasets for specific domains. Implement quality scoring, data augmentation, and validation pipelines. Compare synthetic vs real data effectiveness.
