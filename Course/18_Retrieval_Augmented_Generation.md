## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Production-Ready Enterprise RAG System**
Build comprehensive RAG pipeline for internal company documents using LlamaIndex. Implement document ingestion from multiple sources (PDFs, web pages, databases), create optimized embeddings, and deploy with proper scaling, caching, and monitoring. Include features for document updates and incremental indexing.

**2. Advanced Hybrid Search with Reranking**
Enhance RAG systems by combining traditional keyword-based search (BM25) with semantic vector search. Implement query enhancement techniques, reranking algorithms, and evaluation metrics to improve retrieval accuracy. Compare performance across different query types and document collections.

**3. Graph RAG for Complex Knowledge Queries**
Build Graph RAG system using Neo4j that can handle complex relational queries. Ingest structured data (movies, actors, directors) and implement natural language interfaces for multi-hop reasoning queries. Include features for graph visualization and query explanation.

**4. Conversational and Agentic RAG for Multi-Turn Interactions**
Create agentic RAG system that maintains context across conversation turns and can decompose complex queries into sub-questions. Implement query planning, multi-step reasoning, and result synthesis. Include features for handling follow-up questions and context management.
