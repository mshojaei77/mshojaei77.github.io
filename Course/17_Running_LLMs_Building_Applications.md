## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Production-Ready LLM API with Streaming**
Build complete LLM applications with proper architecture using FastAPI. Implement streaming responses for real-time user interactions and create robust APIs with proper error handling and rate limiting. Include authentication and authorization for secure access.

**2. Conversational AI with Memory Management**
Build memory-enabled chatbots using LangChain that maintain conversation history and context. Implement conversation buffer management and contextually aware conversations. Create comprehensive conversation systems with proper memory handling.

**3. Containerized Deployment and Scaling**
Containerize LLM inference servers using Docker and deploy to Kubernetes clusters. Handle concurrent users with proper load balancing and resource management. Deploy applications to production environments with monitoring and scaling capabilities.

**4. Multi-Modal Assistant Applications**
Build comprehensive multi-modal applications that handle text, images, and other media types. Implement unified LLM API services and create scalable application architectures. Apply best practices for application performance and reliability.
