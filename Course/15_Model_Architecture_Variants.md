## ðŸ”¬ Hands-On Labs

**1. Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture Implementation**
Implement sparse Mixture of Experts layers from scratch in PyTorch. Build gating networks that route tokens to different expert feed-forward networks and implement proper load balancing. Optimize memory usage and computation efficiency while maintaining model quality.

**2. State Space Model Development (Mamba, RWKV)**
Build state space models like Mamba and RWKV from scratch. Implement selective state space mechanisms and compare performance against traditional attention mechanisms. Apply these architectures to various sequence modeling tasks and evaluate their efficiency.

**3. Long Context Architecture Extensions**
Extend context windows using various techniques including interpolation, extrapolation, and sliding window attention. Implement Longformer and BigBird architectures and evaluate their performance on long document processing tasks. Optimize memory usage for extended context scenarios.

**4. Hybrid and Novel Architecture Design**
Design and implement hybrid architectures combining different components (attention, state space, convolution). Apply architecture search techniques to discover optimal configurations for specific tasks. Evaluate architectural innovations on relevant benchmarks and create new architecture variants.
