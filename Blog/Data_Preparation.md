# Data Preparation for LLMs

Data preparation is a crucial step in training large language models. This guide covers the essential processes and techniques for creating high-quality training datasets.

## LLM Training Data Collection

- **Data Sources**
  - Web crawling
  - Academic datasets
  - Books and literature
  - Code repositories
  - Social media content
  - Specialized domain data

- **Data Quality Considerations**
  - Content diversity
  - Language distribution
  - Domain coverage
  - Licensing and permissions
  - Ethical considerations

## Text Cleaning for LLMs

- **Basic Cleaning**
  - HTML/XML removal
  - Unicode normalization
  - Special character handling
  - Whitespace normalization
  - Duplicate line removal

- **Advanced Processing**
  - Language detection
  - Content quality scoring
  - Toxic content filtering
  - PII (Personal Identifiable Information) detection
  - Document structure preservation

## Data Filtering and Deduplication

- **Deduplication Strategies**
  - Exact match detection
  - Near-duplicate detection
  - MinHash algorithms
  - Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
  - N-gram based similarity

- **Quality Filters**
  - Length-based filtering
  - Language quality scores
  - Perplexity filtering
  - Repetition detection
  - Content classifiers

## Creating Training Datasets

- **Dataset Formation**
  - Sampling strategies
  - Data balancing
  - Domain mixing
  - Format standardization

  - Bias detection
  - Representation fairness
  - Content evaluation
  - Statistical analysis

- **Manual Review**
  - Sampling methodology
  - Review guidelines
  - Quality assurance
  - Feedback integration
  - Iterative improvement

## Dataset Annotation Workflows

- **Annotation Types**
  - Classification labels
  - Entity tagging
  - Sentiment annotation
  - Quality ratings
  - Content warnings

- **Annotation Management**
  - Guidelines development
  - Annotator training
  - Quality monitoring
  - Inter-annotator agreement
  - Review processes

## Hugging Face Hub Dataset Management

- **Dataset Hosting**
  - Upload procedures
  - Version control
  - Access management
  - Documentation
  - Community sharing

- **Dataset Cards**
  - Metadata documentation
  - Usage guidelines
  - Limitations
  - Ethical considerations
  - Citation information
